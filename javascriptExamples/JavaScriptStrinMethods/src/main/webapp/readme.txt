They accept the same arguments (parameters), and return the same value?

The two methods are NOT equal. These are the differences:

The search() method cannot take a second start position argument.
The indexOf() method cannot take powerful search values (regular expressions).


slice() extracts a part of a string and returns the extracted part in a new string.
If a parameter is negative, the position is counted from the end of the string.
If you omit the second parameter, the method will slice out the rest of the string:


Note that regular expressions are written without quotes.

JavaScript has only one type of number. Numbers can be written with or without decimals.
